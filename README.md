## recommended tools

- all jumpscale code is checked out under /opt/code in development env or in ~/code/...
- use a ide like atom for development on this code, sourcetree is a good tool for git manipulation
- over ssh you can play with the code in the docker
- to push changes to a remote host (remote development) use j.tools.develop...
